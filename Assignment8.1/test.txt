1).Here you do not need a graphical user interface. Write a program that asks a word from the user and the 
program prints out from a text file all the lines, which contains the word. The name (and path) of the text 
file is asked from the user.

2). Here you do not need a graphical user interface. In a text file, there is data of customers so that first is 
the type of the customer (customer or preferred customer), then customer number, name, address and for 
preferred customers also purchases, every value on its own line, for example

Use your classes of assignment 5.2 to describe the characteristics of different customers. Write a program 
that reads the data from the text file, creates objects, and adds objects to an ArrayList. Print out all the 
objects in the end. The name (and path) of the text file can be written in the program code.

3) Write a program with GUI to handle orders (assignment 4.1). The products and their prices are in a text 
file and the program reads those when it starts. The user can create a new order and add order lines 
(products) to the order. Orders are stored in a collection (ArrayList or HashMap). The user can also search 
orders by the order number. The program has a File menu with items New, Open and Save As. You can use 
ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream to serialize the whole collection to/from a file.

As an attachment of the assignment, you’ll find a zip file. In the zip file, there is a readymade class for the 
graphical user interface and it also reads the products and their prices from the text file. You can use this 
class if you want and implement those parts marked with TODO comment.
